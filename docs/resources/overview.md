# Overview of Resources

Numerous resources serve as tools and companion commentary to the text
of Ms. Fr. 640.

## [List of Entries](/#entries)

The manuscript consists almost entirely of units of text under titles, which the Project has called “entries.” The List of Entries forms an index to navigate the over 900 entries.

Entries can be filtered by selecting semantic tags that have been used to encode relevant terms in each entry. For further information on these tags, see [Principles of
Encoding](/#content/resources/principles-encoding).

## [Entry Categories](/#content/resources/categories)

Entries can be faceted through 26 broad categories, which are intended to provide a quick overview of processes and materials and to help navigate
the manuscript. 

For more information about the manuscript’s contents, see
Pamela H. Smith, [An Introduction to Ms. Fr. 640 and its
Author-Practitioner](/#essays/ann_300_ie_19).

## [Glossary](/#folios/1r/f/1r/glossary)

The Glossary is a record of distinctive terms used in the manuscript
which was compiled during the process of transcribing and translating the text.

It includes:

  - meaning(s) of words according to context
  - bibliographic references for those meanings
  - alternate historical spellings and modern spelling
  - language or dialect of origin

## [Bibliography](/#content/resources/bibliography)

The Bibliography compiles references, texts, and authors cited in the manuscript, the editorial comments, and the glossary.

Each Research Essay also contains a full bibliography of works cited in
the essay.


## [Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding](/#content/resources/principles)

To transform the handwritten pages of Ms. Fr. 640 into digital text, the Making and
Knowing Project transcribed, translated, and encoded Ms. Fr. 640 in a series of collaborative workshops for graduate students since 2014. The protocols guiding this process evolved into these Principles.

A list of [dictionaries and technical encyclopedias](#content/research+resources/dictionaries) was also developed during the
transcription and translation effort.

## [Field Notes](#content/resources/field-notes)

Field notes document students' skill-building exercises and reconstruction work for their Research Essays.

While the Project required students to record every stage of their research, some field notes are more detailed and
comprehensive than others.

Additional photographs taken by the students as they carried out their
research are available in the [Project’s repository on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/albums).

Fr. 640](/#essays/ann_329_ie_19).
