# Field notes

Coming soon

Field notes document students' skill-building exercises and reconstruction work for their laboratory essays.

While the Project required students to record every stage of their research, some field notes are more detailed and
comprehensive than others.

Additional photographs taken by the students as they carried out their
research are available in the [Projectâ€™s repository on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/albums).

For more on field notes as a pedagogical component of the Edition, see Pamela Smith [Making the Edition of Ms.
Fr. 640](/#essays/ann_329_ie_19).
