# Principles of Translation

The translation of Ms. Fr. 640 was carried out by graduate students and
Making and Knowing team members in Paleography and Text Workshops held
by the Making and Knowing Project from 2014 to 2018. It was then checked
and refined by the Paleography Lead Marc Smith and Senior Team
members, Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Pamela Smith, Tillmann
Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.

There is no such thing as a perfect translation. It is always a
compromise, requiring interpretation and judgment, shaped by the
translator’s aims and priorities. Discerning the intended meaning of the
author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was particularly challenging because
it is a technical text containing many obscure and long-forgotten
materials and techniques, as well as because the author-practitioner
seems to have left the manuscript unfinished.

Any of the numerous moving parts of a sentence—obscure nouns, vague
adverbs, knotty subclauses, sequences of tenses and moods—might hold
crucial clues to the success of a complex (and often unknown or lost)
process. Furthermore, the process of translation was carried out by
successive cohorts of students and team members in Paleography and Text
Workshops who generally had no special expertise in the obscure contents
of the manuscript. We translated collectively and in parallel with
laboratory reconstruction and textual research to interpret the text.
The translation underwent multiple campaigns of revision. Our
translation of Ms. Fr. 640 aims to avoid over-interpretation and
maintain ambiguity, providing as literal and consistent a rendering of
the original French as possible. This frequently meant foregoing a more
elegant solution in favor of a clunky and at times archaic rendering
which preserves the author-practitioner's rich, down-to-earth, and
occasionally rambling vernacular.

This “hands-off” approach applies first and foremost to technical terms.
Many sixteenth-century terms for processes and materials have been
obscured or subsumed into different categories in modern art historical
terminology. To keep the original meaning in view, we have refrained
from applying these modern categories wherever possible. For example,
the term *desmenée* in an entry on perspective (fol.
[62v](/#folios/62v)
could easily be identified as the “vanishing point,” but instead we
opted for the more neutral “intersection.” Similarly, the entries on *or
mat* (fol. [66r](/#folios/66r))
describe a process known as mordant gilding in modern English, but to
use that term would be tantamount to imposing a modern technical
definition on the author-practitioner’s understanding of the process.
Technical terms for pigments and other materials were a particular
challenge. The identity of *azur d’esmail* and a range of related blue
pigments in the manuscript has been an ongoing conundrum. Although we
are fairly confident, after extensive research and consultation with
experts over many years, that it refers to smalt, a blue glass
containing cobalt, we are reluctant to impose our conclusions on the
text. For this reason, *azur d’esmail*, *or mat*, and a range of other
terms have been left in the original French. Research essays or editorial notes
detail the state of our knowledge as to their identity.

For many French terms, we chose English translations from contemporary
dictionaries such as Cotgrave’s 1611 *Dictionarie of the French and
English Tongues*, even if they might seem obscure or archaic to modern
readers (see below the full list of dictionaries used). Even if a word
such as “mattrass,” denoting a round-bottomed glass flask, is now rarely
used, it is by far the closest equivalent, both etymologically and in
terms of its technical meaning, to the French *mattelas*. There are
cases, however, where this strategy would have caused more confusion
that it is worth. The small paintbrush called *pinceau*, for example,
would have been known as a “pencil” in English from the sixteenth until
well into the nineteenth century. Being moreover etymologically related
to *pinceau*, “pencil” seems in many ways an ideal candidate. However,
while one might find a “camel hair pencil” in a catalogue of specialist
art equipment even today, the danger of confusing a brush with a
graphite pencil seemed too grave to be left to a disambiguating
editorial note on each instance of the word. Instead, on this occasion
we translated “paintbrush,” prioritizing a clear reference to the
correct tool over the principle of avoiding modern categories.

While the language of Ms. Fr. 640 is overwhelmingly Middle French, some
small portion of the text (single words, phrases, or short passages) is in
languages other than French, including German, Italian, Greek, and Latin. Excerpts in these languages have been transcribed as they appear in the manuscript, marked up with the relevant language tag, and italicized in the Edition. An editorial note (marked by an asterisk) provides an English translation of this text. The author-practitioner also uses a
number of terms derived from Occitan. While Occitan was and is a language
in its own right, the author-practitioner does not appear to be an Occitan
speaker, but rather uses individual Occitan words, adapted to French
spelling to varying degrees, suggesting that these terms had currency in
the French spoken in the Toulouse area and the South more generally. For
this reason, we are not treating these individual terms as a separate
language like Latin or Italian, which the author-practitioner uses for
longer stretches of text. Instead, Occitan-derived terms are marked up
"silently" with the tag, i.e., they are not rendered as foreign words in
italics in the Edition, but can nonetheless be found in the List of Entries (LINK) by selecting "Occitan" from the list of tags. The same goes for a number of terms in Poitevin, the dialect
spoken in and around Poitou, which suggest that the author-practitioner may
hail from that region. These terms are silently marked up with the tag, which can also be selected from the tag set in the List of Entries.

Another important aim of our translation was to preserve the
peculiarities of the author-practitioner’s language. This includes the
odd not-quite-grammatical sentence, but, more importantly, the
author-practitioner’s language of things and processes, which is one of
the key elements that tell us something about his “material imaginary.”
We paid particular attention to language describing materials as alive
and active, with a will of their own. *Azur d’esmail*, for example,
“hates more than any other to be ground, especially with water,” and
with good reason, since this would mean that it “dies & loses all its
color” (fol. [58v](/#folios/58v)).
While this literal translation may sound quaint to modern readers, for
early modern artists and artisans, there would have been nothing unusual
in supposing that matter was a live agent that had to be coaxed or
subdued into the service of human artifice. By preserving the
agency—grammatical and semantic—of materials as well as humans and
animals, our translation aims to immerse the reader in the
author-practitioner’s words and world.

The entire translation was collaborative, and this was a challenge to
the consistency of translation. We therefore developed protocols to try
to limit the range of translations. This, too, can add to awkwardness in
phrasing, but we very much strove for a unified voice over the entire
manuscript—a goal, it must be said, that is somewhat at odds with the
nature of this compiled document. Consistency in translation of material
and process terms was also sought by compiling a glossary over the five
years of Text Workshops that specified to participants what word the
Project had settled on to translate certain oft-repeated words. This
formed the basis of the [Glossary](/#folios/1r/f/1r/glossary) that is now available as one of the
pane views of the Edition. Editorial Team members then further enforced
this consistency by searching for commonly used terms or phrases in a
text editing program to make sure that they were translated with the
agreed-upon term. For example, we reviewed hundreds of variations of the
construction *il faut*, determining how to implement our self-imposed
consistency rules (“one needs (to do),” “one ought not,” or “it is
necessary,” depending on context) or depart from them in edge cases. The
exhilarating but alarming capacity that digital tools allow in enforcing
consistency in a document like this has resulted in a non-literary piece
of literature, as we consciously sacrificed elegance of prose in the
English for a literal rendering and an attempt not to over-interpret
passages whose meaning was unclear.

It must also be noted that the Making and Knowing Project created a
critical edition of a French manuscript with a research apparatus that
is mostly in English, which leads to a somewhat peculiar feature of
providing Editorial Comments across all three versions of the text, as
well as clarifications of meaning in Research Essays, almost entirely in
English. The advantage of the English translation, however, is that it
can serve as a form of index for the French versions of the text because
it contains single terms, whereas the French transcriptions contain many
variant spellings. Thus, if the reader wishes to search for a single
word, e.g., a type of material, the search can be undertaken in English,
and compared to the French variants.

All author additions and deletions, as well as Making and Knowing
editorial corrections to the text, were carried across and made visible
in all three versions of the text. We thought it useful to the reader to
see where the author-practitioner had rethought passages no matter which
version was being read. When it was possible to translate the deleted
words and phrases, we did so in the translation. Where a deleted word
was fragmentary and could not be translated, it was left in French,
indicated by italicized font, but this means there are sometimes
fragments of words interpolated into sentences and even other words.
They are, however, always visible as deletions by the struck-through red
font.

Finally, our translation was further constrained by the need to keep
encoding matched as much as possible across all three versions of the
text. This is desirable because it ensures matching data sets across all
versions of the text, allowing for digital analysis of the Project’s
data. While our translation is faithful to the original and, we hope,
useful for researchers from different disciplines, it can in some places
be challenging at first read. Our edition provides three different aids
to guide the reader across the rockier linguistic territory. Editorial
Comments, signalled by a red asterisk, contain information about the
historical context and translation decisions. The Glossary found on the
reading pane menus provides an alphabetical and searchable list of
distinctive terms used in Ms. Fr. 640 that the team identified as
needing individual definition, providing citations of source(s)
supporting our translation decisions. The Research Essays that accompany
*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France* often explore linguistic particularities and the
interpretation of meaning.
