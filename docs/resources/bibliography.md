# Bibliography

The Bibliography compiles references, texts, and authors cited in Ms. Fr. 640, the Edition's editorial comments, and the Glossary.

This Bibliography includes detailed references for primary sources cited in the manuscript, including—whenever possible—permanent links to electronic facsimiles. Because Ms. Fr. 640 rarely specifies a particular printed edition, the references provided here are those that are more widely available and/or were produced by prominent sixteenth-century publishers (Robert and Henri Estienne, the Aldine press, Christophe Plantin, Hieronymus Froben, Johannes Herwagen, etc.). Other possible editions can be found in the [Universal Short Title Catalogue](https://www.ustc.ac.uk) and similar resources.

The bibliographic databases are available as [BibTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) and HTML, downloadable from the Project’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/bibliographies).

## Sources Cited in the Glossary

Note: The Glossary uses short bibliographic keys instead of full citations, such as [COT1611] for Cotgrave's _A dictionarie of the french and english tongues_. The keys usually combine author name and year of publication or use an acronym such as [OED2008] for _Oxford English Dictionary_ or [DMF2015] for *Dictionnaire du Moyen Français*. Search for Glossary keys in the Bibliography by acronym or author name.
