# Bibliography

The Bibliography compiles references, texts, and authors cited in the manuscript, the editorial comments, and the glossary.

The Glossary uses short bibliographic keys instead of full citations. The keys usually combine author name and year of publication, or use an acronym such as OED for *Oxford English Dictionary* or DMF for *Dictionnaire du Moyen Français*. Search for Glossary keys by acronym or author name.

This bibliography includes detailed references for primary sources cited in the manuscript, including– whenever possible–permanent links to electronic facsimiles. However, since the manuscript rarely specifies a particular printed edition, the references we provide are those that were more widely available, and produced by prominent sixteenth-century publishers (Robert and Henri Estienne, the Aldine press, Christophe Plantin, Hieronymus Froben, Johannes Herwagen, etc). Other possible editions can be found in the [Universal Short Title Catalogue](https://www.ustc.ac.uk) and similar resources.

The bibliographic databases are available as [BibTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) and HTML, downloadable from the Project’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/bibliographies).
