# Principles of Transcription 

The transcription of Ms. Fr. 640 was carried out by graduate students
and Making and Knowing team members in Paleography and Text Workshops
held by the Making and Knowing Project from 2014 to 2018. It was then
checked and refined by the Paleography Lead Marc Smith and Senior Team members, Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Pamela
Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.

Two versions of the transcriptions are included in the Digital Critical
Edition: diplomatic (verbatim) transcription in French and the lightly
normalized French transcription.

## Diplomatic Transcription

The “diplomatic” transcription attempts to render the text and marks of
the manuscript in type as faithfully in ASCII characters as necessary to
assist the reader in gaining a better sense of the original — or better
still, of visually accessing the facsimile — without previous knowledge
of French paleography, while also making the contents available for
treatment as a data set.

Each letter was rendered individually and by a single glyph,
disregarding any linguistically irrelevant variations in letterforms,
determined by position within the word, ligatures or cursivity, whether
conventional in sixteenth-century usage or accidental (see [Ms. Fr. 640’s
letterforms](https://www.makingandknowing.org/text-workshops/letterforms-fancybox/). This means, for example, that even long **s** (**ſ**) (initial and medial) and short **s** (exclusively
final), which would have been distinguished in early-modern print, are
rendered in the modern form as **s**. Thus, “ſans” is transcribed
“sans.”

Additional deviations from sixteenth-century conventions are:

  - Abbreviations are marked up and expanded consistently with the general spelling system of the manuscript.
  - The transcriptions of the letters i/j and u/v, whether uppercase or lowercase, follow modern usage in distinguishing vowels and consonants.
      - While these letters were not considered distinct graphemes (vowel/consonant) in French before the late seventeenth century, the decision to distinguish between them in the transcription not only facilitates reading but also makes full-text word searches more intuitive.
      - The only formal distinction made in Ms. Fr. 640, following early modern orthography, is between v as the initial form and u elsewhere. For example, “vniuersel” is transcribed “universel.”
  -  The æ ligature (but not the œ ligature used in modern French), a form used specifically for Latin and for the Latinate spelling of the prefix præ- in French, has been maintained.

## Normalized Transcription

The “normalized” transcription aims to provide an optimally readable
text, based on the principles commonly observed in modern critical
editions of middle-French texts for grammatical and lexical
disambiguation.

The following normalization protocols were applied:

  -  Capitalization and punctuation: the liberal use in Ms. Fr. 640 of capitals to mark the beginnings of both independent sentences and articulated clauses has been converted into modern punctuation, and capitals applied only to the initials of sentences and proper nouns.
  -  Word separation: blank spaces or apostrophes have been inserted, and no hyphens except to join two parts of a word that are separated in the original over a line break.
      - E.g. “laultre” normalized as “l’aultre”
  - Acute accents: **é** marks stressed, i.e. non-mute, **e** in final syllables, but not in monosyllabic words except for disambiguation between homographs.
      - E.g. “apres” is normalized as “aprés” according to contemporary convention (rather than modern French “après”). This also disambiguates between “aprés” and “âpres” (although the latter does not occur in the manuscript).
  - A grave accent distinguishes **à** (preposition) from **a** (verb), **là** (adverb) from **la** (article), and **où** (relative pronoun) from **ou** (conjunction).
  - Occasional diacritics: diereses and cedillas.
      - E.g. “Noël” and “sçavoir”

## Deletions, Changes, and Marks

Both transcriptions document all deletions and changes in the
manuscript, even of minor slips of the pen, transcribed as far as
possible.

Ms. Fr. 640 contains conventional symbols for measurements, such as dram
and ounce, as well as for metals. These are rendered by unicode symbols,
as shown below.

The manuscript also contains many other marks that do not have unicode
equivalents, such as hash marks with three strokes rather than two.
These are rendered in the transcriptions and translation by thumbnail
figures excerpted from the
facsimile.
