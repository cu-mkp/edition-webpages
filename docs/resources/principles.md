# Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding

The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript was
“grad-sourced” in a series of paleography and text workshops
(2014–2018) that brought together international graduate students to
become fluent in reading middle French script by transcribing and
translating Ms. Fr. 640.

For a full list of all participants in these workshops, see [Credits](/#content/about/credits).

From 2016 to 2019, intensive translation and markup campaigns further
refined the text.

All work was checked and finalized by the Making and Knowing Team: Terry
Catapano, Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith,
Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.
