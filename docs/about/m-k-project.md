# About the Making and Knowing Project

The [Making and Knowing Project](https://www.makingandknowing.org/), founded in 2014 by Pamela H. Smith, and involving hundreds of collaborators, is a research and pedagogical initiative in the [Center for Science and Society](https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. See [Credits](/#content/about/credits) and, on the Project's website, [Collaborations](https://www.makingandknowing.org/collaborators/).

The Project explores the intersections between historical craft making and scientific knowing. Drawing on techniques from both laboratory and archival research as well as studio practice and the digital humanities, the Making and Knowing Project aims to cross the science/humanities divide.

The creation of _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been the Project’s primary endeavor since 2014. This goal has shaped the Project’s methodology of fusing pedagogy with research, using a focused research object (Ms. Fr. 640) to teach historical, hands-on, and digital research methods while generating research outputs.

_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ sheds light not only on what kind of knowledge the manuscript’s anonymous author-practitioner possessed about techniques and materials, but also, more broadly, how his work of making was related to knowing. 

Indeed, the overarching theme of the Project and its work on _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been to show the ways in which making is an epistemic activity. In other words, making is itself a form of knowledge and not just an application of knowledge.
