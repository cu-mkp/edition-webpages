# About the Edition

## What is the Digital Critical Edition?

This digital critical edition and English translation of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640, held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text in French transcription and English translation for the first time, and situates its contents in their material and historical context.

The manuscript provides insights into the material, technical, and intellectual world of the late sixteenth century, and brings a better understanding of how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected and appreciated in early modern Europe.

The Making and Knowing Project has created this Edition through a series of collaborative workshops, courses, and conferences that involved students, craft practitioners, artists, scholars of the humanities and social sciences, natural and computer scientists, and scholar-practitioners from the emerging field of the digital humanities.

## Creation of the Edition
The creation of _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been the primary goal of the Making and Knowing Project since it was founded in 2014. It presents the culmination of over five years of iterative, collaborative, and interdisciplinary work.

The Edition was developed through a series of  workshops, courses, and conferences:

### Text Workshops
The first stage of transcription, translation, and encoding of the manuscript was carried out in a series of paleography and text workshops (2014–2018) that brought together graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to learn to read middle French script through transcription exercises and then through intensive transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640.

The manuscript’s encoding explores fourteen semantic categories that the Project deemed meaningful in providing insight into the manuscript: animal, body part, currency, environment, material, measurement, medical, music, personal name, place, plant, profession, sensory, and tool. 

For more information, see [Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding](/#content/resources/principles).

### Laboratory Seminars and Research Essays
Students in the Making and Knowing Project’s laboratory seminars from 2014 to 2018 used the transcriptions and translations to investigate the materials and techniques contained in the manuscript.

These students produced essays that featured their research on texts and objects, as well as their experiments in reconstructing the technical processes and recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. The essays gloss entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and provide contextual information for the manuscript more generally.

The student essays were edited extensively by members of the Making and Knowing Project team, after which scholars participating in annual Working Group Meetings commented upon them. They were edited again in 2019 by the Making and Knowing Senior Project team.

The research apparatus of _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ also includes a collection of research essays authored by Working Group members and invited collaborators that discuss different aspects of the context of Ms. Fr. 640. For more, see [Research Essays](/#essays).

### Digital Development
The final component of the creation of the Edition was the prototyping of digital components in digital humanities courses held by the Making and Knowing Project at Columbia University, and the development of the
Edition platform by the Project Digital Team and Performant Software
Solutions. For more information on making the Edition, see Pamela H. Smith, [Making the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640](/#essays/ann_329_ie_19).

  - In-depth multimedia essays that focus on the laboratory reconstruction of selected manuscript entries
  - Field notes from laboratory reconstructions of select recipes
  - Principles of transcription, translation, and encoding
  - Bibliography of works cited
  - Editorial and translation comments

## Research Essays

Research Essays explore the text of the manuscript, provide material,
technical, and historical context, and discuss student reconstructions
in the Making and Knowing Laboratory.
<br>
**Essays by scholars** on the Making and Knowing Team and invited
experts explore different aspects of Ms. Fr. 640 and its material, technical,
textual, and historical context.
<br>
**Essays by students** are products of the Making and Knowing Project laboratory seminars
and courses taught by Project collaborators. The majority addresses historical questions by
combining laboratory work with traditional historical research.
<br>
All essays will also be archived in [Academic Commons](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu) where they can be
downloaded as stand-alone articles.
<br>
The Research Essays are grouped in up to three of seven broad categories:

  - **An Introduction**: written by Project and invited scholars, these essay serve as introductory resources and provide overviews of the Edition and the manuscript itself (including its codicology, probable genesis, relationship to other genres of writing, and the identity of its anonymous author-practitioner).

  - **Art and Its Making**: materials, making, and meaning of art, and the training of artists.
  
  - **Knowing Nature**: investigation, manipulation, and exploration of the materials and principles of nature in Fr.640.
  
  - **Society and Culture**: historical context of the manuscript, and society and culture in sixteenth-century France.

  - **The Making and Knowing Project**: the Making and Knowing Project, including its initiatives, pedagogy, methods, personnel, and collaborators.
