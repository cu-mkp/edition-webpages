## Research and Resources

### Overview

This **Edition** consists of **four views of of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640**: facsimile images of the text, a complete diplomatic (verbatim) transcription in French, a lightly normalized French version, and an English Translation. These  versions can be read and browsed in dual-pane book view by navigating to “The Text” --\> “Folios.”

### rinciples of transcription, translation, and encoding
    
The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscriptwas “grad-sourced” in a series of paleography and text workshops (2014-2018) that brought together international graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to become fluent in reading middle French script by intensive transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640. From 2016-2018, intensive translation and markup campaigns further refined the text. Allo grad-sourced work was checked by the Making and Knowing Team (Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz).

    > the course of transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640. It is

  - > A **Glossary** of distinctive terms used in the manuscript can be
    > accessed by selecting “Glossary” on the pane view menu. It can
    > also be accessed by selecting “Research and Resources”--\>
    > “Glossary.”
    
      - > The glossary contains:
        
          - > Meaning of words
        
          - > Alternate spellings
        
          - > Language/dialect of origin
        
          - > Modern spelling
        
          - > Part of speech
        
          - > Bibliographic references
    
      - > The glossary can be navigated by clicking on the relevant
        > letter, or by using the search box to find a particular word
        > (or browser find function if the search box does not include
        > modern spelling etc. – TBD
    
      - > To perform a word search (PLS SPECIFY WHETHER BOTH ARE
        > POSSIBLE?- MODERN SPELLING OR SPELLING IN MS?), or Searches in
        > the Glossary can be done by head word (open question about
        > alternate spellings),
    
      - > \[Disclaimer about variant spellings (add h or l etc.)\] If a
        > word from the manuscript text returns no hits in the glossary,
        > try searching for a shorter string (e.g. the beginning of the
        > word) or a different spelling. The author-practitioner’s early
        > modern French shows little standardization, and while the
        > glossary includes most common spelling variants, the list is
        > not exhaustive. Common variations are:
        
          - > double vs. single consonant, as in *plate* vs. *platte*
        
          - > homonyms, e.g. aiguille, esguille; alun, alum, alung
