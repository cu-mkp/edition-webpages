**Research and Resources**

### Overview 

This **Edition** consists of **four views of of the French  manuscript Ms. Fr. 640**: facsimile images of the text, a complete  diplomatic (verbatim) transcription in French, a lightly  normalized French version, and an English Translation. These  versions can be read and browsed in dual-pane book view by  navigating to “The Text” --\> “Folios.”



 ### Principles of transcription, translation, and encoding

The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript
 was “grad-sourced” in a series of paleography and text
 workshops (2014-2018) that brought together international
 graduate students (already in possession of advanced French)
 to become fluent in reading middle French script by intensive
 transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640. From 2016-2018,
 intensive translation and markup campaigns further refined the
 text. Allo grad-sourced work was checked by the Making and
 Knowing Team (Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith,
 Pamela Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz).

### Reference Tools 

A list of dictionaries and technical encyclopedia was used during  the course of transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640. It is  available here: LINK to this resource?

A **Glossary** of distinctive terms used in the manuscript can be  accessed by selecting “Glossary” on the pane view menu. It can  also be accessed by selecting “Research and Resources”--\>  “Glossary.”

- The glossary contains:
  - Meaning of words
  - Alternate spellings
  - Language/dialect of origin
  - Modern spelling
  - Part of speech
  - Bibliographic references

The glossary can be navigated by clicking on the relevant letter, or by using the search box to find a particular word
(or browser find function if the search box does not include modern spelling etc. – TBD

To perform a word search (PLS SPECIFY WHETHER BOTH ARE POSSIBLE?- MODERN SPELLING OR SPELLING IN MS?), or Searches in the Glossary can be done by head word (open question about alternate spellings),

\[Disclaimer about variant spellings (add h or l etc.)\] If a word from the manuscript text returns no hits in the glossary, try searching for a shorter string (e.g. the beginning of the word) or a different spelling. The author-practitioner’s early modern French shows little standardization, and while the glossary includes most common spelling variants, the list is not exhaustive. Common variations are:

 - double vs. single consonant, as in *plate* vs. *platte*
 - homonyms, e.g. aiguille, esguille; alun, alum, alung
 - Sample entry:

```
 Acoustrer (mod. accoutrer): v. to prepare \[COT1611\]
```

In this entry, the word as it appears in Ms. Fr. 640 is followed by its modern spelling, its part of speech, and its meaning in English. The key in square brackets links to the source of the definition in the Bibliography.

### Editorial Comments

Editorial comments marked by a red asterisk occur throughout the text of the Edition to clarify structural features of the text (such as deletions, additions, marks, etc.), definitions of obscure terms, translation decisions, and historical and textual information. Editorial Comments can also be accessed by selecting “Research and Resources”--\> “Editorial Comments.”

### Research Essays 

Research Essays clarify the text of the manuscript, provide  material, technical, and historical context, and describe student reconstructions in the Making and Knowing Laboratory. These essays can be accessed by clicking on the XX icon to be found on the upper right of the manuscript entry to which the essay pertains. They can also be read by navigating to “Research and Resources”--\> “Research Essays.” Clicking on manuscript folio numbers referenced in the essays links out to the relevant folio page (return by clicking the back arrow in your browser).

Research essays are grouped in up to three of six broad categories, which allow users to filter results:

 - **The Manuscript, Ms. Fr. 640**: Essays that provide
 information about the manuscript (its codicology,
 palaeography, and probable genesis), its relationship to other
 genres of writing, and the identity of its anonymous
 author-practitioner.

 - **The Making and Knowing Laboratory**: discuss hands-on work
 in the Making and Knowing Laboratory, principles of
 reconstruction, and results and conclusions from experimental
 work.

 - **Society and Culture**: treat the historical context of the
 manuscript, and society and culture in sixteenth-century
 France.

 - **Art and its Making**: discuss the materials, making, and
 meaning of art, and the training of artists.

 - **Knowing Nature**: explore the investigation, manipulation,
 and exploration of the materials and principles of nature in
 Ms. Fr. 640.

 - **The Making and Knowing Project**: discuss The Making and
 Knowing Project, including its initiatives, pedagogy, methods,
 personnel, and collaborators.

#### Essays 

Essays have been composed by 

**Scholars** on the Making and Knowing Team and by experts invited by the Team. These essays 
primarily provide material, technical, textual, and historical  information about the contents of Ms. Fr. 640. They are marked by  a COLOR bar at the base of each essay thumbnail.

**Students** in the Making and Knowing Project laboratory seminars  and in courses of Project collaborators have also composed essays.  The majority of these essays ask historical questions of the  manuscript and its context that can be illuminated by laboratory  research (in combination with more conventional historical  research). These essays are marked by a COLOR bar at the base of  each essay thumbnail.

- Author and citation information is provided at the top of every  essay.
- By clicking on folio numbers in the essay, users may jump to that  page, then return to the essay by using the back arrow of their  browser.

### Field notes 
 
Field Notes recorded by students as they carried out their  skill-building exercises, and as they planned, researched,  reconstructed, and wrote their laboratory essays can be found  linked in each Student Research Essay, and can also be browsed by  navigating to “Research and Resources”--\> “Fieldnotes.” The  Project required students to keep field notes of every stage of  their research, however, some field notes are more detailed and  comprehensive than others. Additional photographs taken by the  students as they carried out their research are available in the  Project’s repository on Flickr: For more on how fieldnotes were  integrated into the pedagogical components of the Edition, see  Pamela Smith, “Creation of the Edition,” ann....

 ### Bibliography
 
A Bibliography of all works cited in the Edition can be  accessed here: Each Research Essay also contains a full bibliography of works cited in the essay.

Bibliographic references include primary and secondary literature  cited in the glossary, the editorial comments and, eventually, the  research essays.

Bibliographic references cited in the editorial comments are either secondary sources providing additional information on the topic at hand, or primary sources mentioned in the manuscript.  While we provide detailed references of these primary sources, we  cannot always be certain that the specific edition we cited is the  one that the author-practitioner has used. In most cases, we  provide a non-exhaustive selection of printed editions, giving  priority to more widely available editions and more prominent  publishers (Robert and Henri Estienne, Aldo Manuzio, Christophe  Plantin, Hieronymus Froben, Johannes Herwagen, etc). To search for  other possible editions, we provide users with a link to the  Universal Short Title Catalogue whenever possible.

The references in the Bibliography are filterable by:

- Type of source (primary, secondary)
- Document of origin (Manuscript text, Editorial Comment, Glossary, Research Essay)
- Online Availability (access to external databases)
- Degree of certainty

The bibliographic databases are available in BibTeX format and downloadable from GitHub.

### Entries

A **List of Entries** (that is, the headings of all 928 “recipes,”  or entries in Ms. Fr. 640) can be browsed or searched by  navigating to “The text” --\> “List of Entries.” Relevant terms in  each entry have been encoded using fourteen semantic tags, and the  terms contained in any given entry are listed below the entry.  Clicking on any of the tags gives a comprehensive list of encoded  terms in the entry. The tags are

- animal
- body part
- currency
- environment
- material
- measurement
- medical
- music
- personal name
- place
- plant
- profession
